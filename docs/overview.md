# Overview of DDoS Attacks and Defense

## Introduction

**Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks are one of the most common and disruptive types of cyber attack. These attacks overwhelm the target system with a flood of internet traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users. While often associated with malicious intent, DDoS attacks can also serve as a tool for demonstrating the vulnerabilities of a network or testing its resilience.

This document serves as an introduction of DDoS, covering its basic concepts, characteristics, and the various forms of attack. It will also touch on the general defense mechanisms used to mitigate or stop DDoS attacks.

## What is a DDoS Attack?

A **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of Internet traffic. DDoS attacks typically come from a distributed network of compromised devices (a botnet), making them much harder to defend against compared to traditional DoS (Denial of Service) attacks, which come from a single source.
