# DDOS-Study-Notes

A comprehensive collection of my personal study notes, experiments, and scripts related to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and deense mechanisms. Includes documentation on attack types, mitigation strategies, and code exmaples in various programming languages.

## Repository Structure

- **`docs/`**: Contains documentation on DDoS attack types and defense methods.
- **`scripts/`**: Contains various DDoS attack scripts in different programming languages like Rust, Python, Bash, and Go.
- **`resources/`**: A collection of external learning resources, including articles, videos, and books.
- **`references/`**: A list of academic papers, research articles, and references.

## Table of Contents

- [Overview] (docs/overview.md)
- [Type of DDoS Attacks] (docs/attack-types.md)
- [DDoS Defense Methods] (docs/defense-methods.md)
- [Scripts] (scripts/)
- [Learning Resources] (resources/)
- [References] (references/)

## Goals of This Repository

- **Learn about DDoS Attacks**: Understand different types of DDoS attacks and their impack.
- **Experiment with DDoS Scripts**: Build and analyze scripts to simulate DDoS attacks and defense mechanisms.
- **Explore Mitigation Strategies**: Research and document methods for defending against DDoS attacks.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Explore the `docs/` folder to learn about DDoS attacks and defense methods.
2. If you want to experiment with DDoS scripts, check the `scripts/` folder. Each script comes with an explaination of how it works and how to use it.
3. Visit the `resources/` folder for external learning meterials.
4. For any research or academic references, see the `references/` folder.
