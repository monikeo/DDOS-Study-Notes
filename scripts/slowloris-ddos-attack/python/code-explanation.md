## Code Explanation

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

```python
import socket
import time
```

- socket: This module allows Python to interact with network connections.
- time: This module provides the sleep() function to pause the script for a specified time.

## The Slowloris Function

```python
def slowloris(target_ip, target_port, num_connections=200):
    s = socket.socket(socket.AP_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((target_ip, target_port))
```

- The slowloris function accepts three parameters:
    - target_ip: IP address of the target server.
    - target_port: Port to target (default is port 80 for HTTP).
    - num_connections: Number of connections to open (defualt is 200)

- A new socket s is created using socket.AF_INET(IPv4) and socket.SOCK_STREAM (TCP)
- The socket then connects to the target IP and port using the connect() method.

## Creating the HTTP Request

```python
    request = "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    request += f"Host: {target_ip}\r\n"
    request += "Connection: Keep-Alive\r\n"
    request += "User-Agent: Slowloris\r\n"
    request += "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\n\r\n"
```

- The script constructs an imcomplete HTTP GET request
    - GET / HTTP/1.1: This requests the root page of the target
    - Host: <target_ip>: This sets the host header to the target server's IP address.
    - Connection: Keep-Alive: This instructs the server to keep the connection open.
    - User-Agent: Slowloris: Identifies the client as "Slowloris" to the server.
    - Accep-Encoding: gzip, deflate: Specifies that the client can accept compressed data.

## Sending Data Periodically

```python
```
